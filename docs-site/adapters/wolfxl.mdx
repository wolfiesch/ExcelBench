WolfXL is a hybrid Rust library that combines three backends:

| Operation | Backend | Speed vs openpyxl |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Read | calamine (styled fork) | **4-6x faster** |
| Write | rust_xlsxwriter | **5x faster** |
| Modify | XlsxPatcher (ZIP surgery) | **10-14x faster** |

## Install

```bash
pip install wolfxl
# or
uv add wolfxl
```

## Usage

```python
import wolfxl

# Read
wb = wolfxl.load_workbook("data.xlsx")
ws = wb.active
val = ws["A1"].value

# Write
wb = wolfxl.Workbook()
ws = wb.active
ws["A1"] = "Hello, world"
wb.save("output.xlsx")

# Modify (surgical patch — no full rewrite)
wb = wolfxl.load_workbook("template.xlsx", modify=True)
ws = wb.active
ws["B2"] = 42
wb.save("patched.xlsx")
```

## How Modify Works

Standard Excel libraries rewrite the entire `.xlsx` ZIP archive on save. WolfXL's modify mode instead patches only the changed XML sheets in-place, leaving all other ZIP entries untouched.

This is 10-14x faster for templates with large static content (images, charts, pivot tables) where only a few cells change.

## Benchmark Scores

From the current ExcelBench run:

| Axis | Score |
|------|-------|
| Fidelity | 87.5% (14/16 features = 3) |
| Read Speed | 100 (5.9x openpyxl, capped) |
| Write Speed | 100 (3.7x openpyxl, capped) |
| Feature Coverage | 88.2% |
| Capability Breadth | 100 (R+W+Modify) |

Known gaps: `alignment` (indent level) = 1/3, `images` (read) = 0/3.
