openpyxl is ExcelBench's reference adapter. Its output defines "correct" for write verification when Excel is not available.

## Scores

| Axis | Score |
|------|-------|
| Fidelity | 100% (16/16 features green) |
| Read Speed | 50 (baseline) |
| Write Speed | 50 (baseline) |
| Feature Coverage | 94.1% |
| Capability Breadth | 66 (R+W, no modify) |

## Install

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook, Workbook

# Read
wb = load_workbook("data.xlsx")
ws = wb.active
val = ws["A1"].value

# Write
wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active
ws["A1"] = "value"
wb.save("output.xlsx")

# Read-only mode (faster, less memory)
wb = load_workbook("data.xlsx", read_only=True)
```

## Why It's the Reference

- Highest fidelity among Python libraries (100% in ExcelBench)
- Produces spec-compliant `.xlsx` output
- Maintained by the Python/Excel community since 2010
- Used as the CI oracle when Excel is not available

## Tradeoffs

openpyxl is **slow** by default. For large files:

- Use `read_only=True` for reading (no in-memory model built)
- Consider WolfXL for 4-6x read speedup with comparable fidelity
