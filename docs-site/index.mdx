## What is ExcelBench?

ExcelBench scores Python Excel libraries on two dimensions:

- **Fidelity** — does the library correctly read and write Excel features?
- **Performance** — how fast is it, and how much memory does it use?

It tests **17 features** across **12+ adapters** using real Excel-generated fixtures as ground truth. Every score is reproducible from a single command.

## Why It Exists

Picking an Excel library for Python involves tradeoffs that are hard to quantify:

- openpyxl is the reference — full fidelity, but slow
- calamine is fast for reads but Python-only-no-styles
- xlsxwriter writes beautifully but can't read
- pandas wraps openpyxl but adds overhead

ExcelBench makes those tradeoffs concrete. Every claim is backed by a test.
