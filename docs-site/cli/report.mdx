All visualization commands work from pre-existing `results.json` files — no re-run needed.

## `report`

```bash
uv run excelbench report --input results/xlsx/results.json --output results/xlsx
```

Regenerates markdown, CSV, and JSON summary from a completed benchmark run.

**Output:**
- `results.md` — Full feature x library matrix
- `results.csv` — Flat CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- `summary.md` — Tier list + adapter capability table

---

## `heatmap`

```bash
uv run excelbench heatmap
```

Generates a feature x library heatmap as PNG and SVG. Reads from `results/xlsx/results.json` by default.

---

## `html`

```bash
uv run excelbench html --output deploy/index.html
```

Generates a single self-contained HTML file with:

- Fidelity overview table (sortable)
- Strength profile radar charts (Plotly)
- Interactive fidelity-vs-throughput scatter
- Per-feature drill-down

This is what deploys to [excelbench.vercel.app](https://excelbench.vercel.app).

---

## `dashboard`

```bash
uv run excelbench dashboard
```

Generates a combined static dashboard (PNG/SVG) showing fidelity and performance side-by-side.

---

## `scatter`

```bash
uv run excelbench scatter
```

Generates fidelity-vs-throughput scatter plots as PNG and SVG, broken down by tier.
