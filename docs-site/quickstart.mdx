## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynthGL/excelbench
cd excelbench
uv sync
```

To include the WolfXL Rust adapter (pre-built wheel from PyPI):

```bash
uv sync --extra rust
```

## Run a Benchmark

The repo ships with pre-built `.xlsx` fixtures, so you can benchmark immediately without Excel installed:

```bash
uv run excelbench benchmark --tests fixtures/excel --output results
```

This runs fidelity tests on all registered adapters and writes results to `results/xlsx/`.

## Generate a Report

```bash
uv run excelbench report --input results/xlsx/results.json --output results/xlsx
```

Produces `results.md`, `results.csv`, and `summary.md`.

## Open the Dashboard

```bash
uv run excelbench html --output deploy/index.html
open deploy/index.html
```

Or visit the live version at [excelbench.vercel.app](https://excelbench.vercel.app).

## Run Both Profiles

ExcelBench tests both `.xlsx` and `.xls` formats:

```bash
uv run excelbench benchmark-profiles --output results
```

## Performance Benchmarks

```bash
uv run excelbench perf --tests fixtures/excel --output results
```

See [Performance CLI](/cli/perf) for all options.

<Note>
Fixture generation (creating the ground-truth `.xlsx` files from scratch) requires Excel installed on macOS via xlwings. The pre-built fixtures in `fixtures/excel/` are tracked in git and work everywhere.
