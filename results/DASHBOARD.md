## Library Comparison

| Library | Caps | Green Features | Pass Rate | Best For |
|---------|:----:|:--------------:|:---------:|----------|

| rust_xlsxwriter | W | 8/18 | 68% | General use |
| xlwt | W | 4/18 | 58% | Legacy .xls file writes |
| openpyxl-readonly | R | 3/18 | 22% | Streaming reads when formatting isn't needed |
| pandas | R+W | 3/18 | 19% | Data analysis pipelines (accept NaN coercion) |
| pyexcel | R+W | 3/18 | 20% | Multi-format compatibility layer |
| tablib | R+W | 3/18 | 20% | Dataset export/import workflows |
| pylightxl | R+W | 2/18 | 18% | Lightweight value extraction |

## Key Insights

- **Fidelity leaders**: openpyxl (18/18 green features)
- **Abstraction cost**: pandas wraps openpyxl but drops from 18 to 3 green features due to DataFrame coercion
- **Optimization cost**: xlsxwriter constant_memory mode loses 3 green features for lower memory usage
