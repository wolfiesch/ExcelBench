# Merged Cells

Merge cell ranges in Excel workbooks.

## Reading Merged Ranges

```python
from excelbench_rust import UmyaBook

book = UmyaBook.open("report.xlsx")
merged = book.read_merged_ranges("Sheet1")
print(merged)  # ["A1:D1", "B3:B5"]
```

## Writing Merged Ranges

```python
book = UmyaBook()
book.add_sheet("Data")

# Write header spanning 4 columns
book.write_cell_value("Data", "A1", {"type": "string", "value": "Quarterly Report"})
book.merge_cells("Data", "A1:D1")

# Center the merged header
book.write_cell_format("Data", "A1", {"h_align": "center", "bold": True})

book.save("output.xlsx")
```

## How Excel Handles Merged Cells

!!! info "Value placement"
    When cells are merged, only the **top-left cell** retains the value.
    Reading any other cell in the merged range returns a blank value.
    This is an Excel specification behavior, not a pyumya limitation.

## Edge Cases

- Merging a range that overlaps an existing merge will raise an error in Excel
- Single-cell "merges" (e.g., `"A1:A1"`) are valid but have no visual effect
- Merged cells with borders apply the border to the entire merged region

!!! note "Unmerge"
    Unmerging is not currently exposed in the Python API. If you need it, open
    an issue and include the exact Excel behavior you want (preserve top-left
    value, how to handle formatting, etc.).
