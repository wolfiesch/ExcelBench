# Limitations & Compatibility

This page documents known limitations, unsupported features, and compatibility notes.
We aim to be honest about what pyumya can and cannot do.

### Not Supported (umya-spreadsheet limitations)

These features are not supported by the underlying Rust library either.

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Macro execution | Existing macros preserved on read/write, but cannot be created or run |
| External links | References to other workbooks not supported |
| OLE objects | Embedded objects not supported |
| Smart Art | Not supported |
| 3D charts | Only 2D chart types |
| Form controls | Not supported |
| Digital signatures | Not supported |
| Power Query connections | Not supported |
| Custom add-in functions | Not supported |

## Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|:------------:|:------:|
| macOS 11+ | x86_64 | Tested |
| macOS 11+ | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | Tested |
| Linux (glibc 2.17+) | x86_64 | Expected to work |
| Linux (glibc 2.17+) | aarch64 | Expected to work |
| Windows 10+ | x86_64 | Expected to work |

!!! note "Current installation"
    pyumya currently requires a Rust toolchain for building. Precompiled wheels
    for pip installation are planned for the standalone PyPI release.

## Python Version Support

- Python 3.11+ required (matches ExcelBench's minimum)
- PyO3 0.22 binding

## Known Issues

### Single-save limitation

`UmyaBook.save()` can only be called once per instance. The internal spreadsheet
is consumed on save. To write the same workbook to multiple locations, open or
create separate instances.

### Thread safety

`UmyaBook` is marked as `unsendable` in PyO3 and cannot be shared across Python
threads. Create separate instances per thread.

### Date system

pyumya uses the Excel 1900 date system exclusively. The 1904 date system (used by
some older macOS Excel files) is not explicitly handled — dates from such files
may be off by ~4 years.

### Row indexing

Row indices in `read_row_height`, `set_row_height` are **0-based** (matching Python
convention). This differs from Excel's 1-based row numbers and from the cell
reference format (e.g., "A1" refers to row 1).
